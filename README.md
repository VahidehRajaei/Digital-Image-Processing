📸 Digital Image Processing: Midterm Assignment (ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset)This repository contains the code and documentation for the Intermediate Exam Assignment for the Digital Image Processing course at Üsküdar University. The project focuses on applying and analyzing fundamental and advanced image processing techniques across both RGB and Grayscale formats using a subset of the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset.🎯 Project GoalThe primary goal is to practically implement and comparatively analyze various image processing operations—ranging from enhancement and noise reduction to frequency domain analysis (FFT)—to evaluate their effect on dermatoscopic images.📂 Project StructureFile/FolderDescriptionDigital_Image_Processing_Midterm.ipynbThe main Jupyter Notebook containing all code implementations, visualizations, and mandatory analysis comments (Steps 1 through 7).report.docxThe final Word report including all processed images, comparisons, and detailed interpretations.data/train/(External) The directory where the actual ISIC images (organized by class) should reside.README.mdThis file.⚙️ PrerequisitesTo run the project notebook (.ipynb), ensure you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment (preferably via Anaconda/Miniconda):Bash# Recommended installation via pip
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib seaborn jupyter
LibraryPurposeopencv-python (cv2)Core library for image loading, manipulation, and processing.numpyEssential for numerical operations, array manipulation, and FFT.pandasUsed for managing the image paths and metadata (train_df).matplotlib / seabornUsed for visualization and plotting histograms.💾 Data SetupThe code assumes the images are organized into class subfolders.Download: Obtain the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset (or the specific Kaggle version used).Organize: Ensure your Train folder structure is as follows:/data/train/
├── actinic keratosis/
├── basal cell carcinoma/
└── ... (other 7 class folders)
Update Path: Before running the notebook, update the IMAGE_FOLDER_PATH variable in the first code cell of the notebook to match the absolute path of your local Train folder.▶️ Execution StepsOpen the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open Digital_Image_Processing_Midterm.ipynb.Initial Setup: Execute the first few cells to import libraries and define the load_isic_paths_from_subfolders function.Data Loading (Step 1): Execute the cell that calls the loading function to create the train_df.Run Sequentially: Execute the remaining cells in sequence (Steps 2 through 7). The code will automatically select a sample image and apply all required transformations (Enhancement, Noise Reduction, FFT, Sharpening, etc.).🔍 Key Techniques CoveredStepTechniqueOutput Analysis2Visualization & StatisticsRGB/Grayscale comparison, Histogram analysis.3EnhancementContrast Stretching, Histogram Equalization (YCrCb), Gamma Correction ($\gamma = 0.5, 2.0$).4Noise ReductionMedian vs. Gaussian Blur comparison (Edge preservation vs. Detail loss).5GeometricRandom Rotation, Horizontal Flipping (Symmetry analysis).6Frequency DomainFFT, LPF application, and Inverse FFT reconstruction.7Detail & ScaleUnsharp Masking and Bicubic Interpolation (2x).👩‍💻 AuthorVAHIDEH RAJAEIPOURCourse: Digital Image ProcessingUniversity: Üsküdar Üniversitesi

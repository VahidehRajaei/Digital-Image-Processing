### Digital Image Processing: Midterm Assignment (ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset)
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Intermediate Exam Assignment for the Digital Image Processing course at Üsküdar University. The project focuses on applying and analyzing fundamental and advanced image processing techniques across both RGB and Grayscale formats using a subset of the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset.
Project Goal
The primary goal is to practically implement and comparatively analyze various image processing operations—ranging from enhancement and noise reduction to frequency domain analysis (FFT)—to evaluate their effect on dermatoscopic images

### Prerequisites
To run the project notebook (.ipynb), ensure you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment (preferably via Anaconda/Miniconda):
#### Recommended installation via pip
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib seaborn jupyter
### Data Setup
The code assumes the images are organized into class subfolders.
**Download:** Obtain the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset (or the specific Kaggle version used)
**Update Path:** Before running the notebook, update the IMAGE_FOLDER_PATH variable in the first code cell of the notebook to match the absolute path of your local Train folder.
